## About the Swiss Ephemeris:

Swiss Ephemeris (SE) is a software toolbox for programmers of astrological
software. It is of little use for a non-programmer

Swiss Ephemeris was developed by Dieter Koch and Alois Treindl, while both were
employed by Astrodienst AG in Zollikon/ZÃ¼rich Switzerland.

Most astrological programmers all over the world use Swiss Ephemeris in their
software. 

SE ist built according to the highest standards of precision available
in astronomical data, with raw data from Nasa's JPL. It is able to reproduce the ephemeris data in
astronomical standard books up to the last printed digit.

Detailed information is available at https://www.astro.com/swisseph
or in the documentation files included here (folder doc).

containing

sweph.zip

	The complete Swiss Ephemeris package for Windows (32bit),
	except the ephemeris data files.
	See online documentation at https://www.astro.com/swisseph
	or in the doc directory for more details.
	Small sample programs and build-projects are included for
	- Visual C++ .net 2003
	- Visual Basic 5.0 
	- Delphi 32-bit
	Note: Visual Basic files may not have been updated and
	tested, as we currently do not possess a working copy of VB at Astrodienst.

folder vb:

	declarations for 32-bit and 64-bit Visual Basic

folder programs:

	A directory containing sample and utility programs for Windows:
	swetest.exe:
	executable Swiss Ephemeris program.
	This is a 32-bit Console mode application.
	To get information about the many features of this program, run
	swetest -? > out.txt
	and print the file out.txt, or view it with your text editor.
	This is just a sample to demonstrate the precision of the
	ephemeris, and to show the typical use of a few calls.

## Asteroid files for all available numbered asteroids (more than 620'000)

Each file covers 600 years, from 1500 - 2099. They are organized in folders of 1000 files each, 
available in Alois' public Dropbox area in folder 'all_ast' with this link:

https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/y3naz62gy6f6qfrhquu7u/h?rlkey=ejltdhb262zglm7eo6yfj2940&dl=0

The ast* folders are organized in folders like ast_0_99 in groups of 100 each. Dropbox is a bit 
slow with large numbers of folders which each contain 1000 files. It handles 100 such folders better then 620.

The total volume was 29 Gb in September 2023.

## Asteroid files for all available named asteroids (more than 24'000)

Each file covers the long range of 6000 years, from 3000 BCE to 2999 CE. 
available in Alois' public Dropbox area in folder 'long_ast' with this link

https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/y3naz62gy6f6qfrhquu7u/h?rlkey=ejltdhb262zglm7eo6yfj2940&dl=0

The total volume was 11 Gb in September 2023.
